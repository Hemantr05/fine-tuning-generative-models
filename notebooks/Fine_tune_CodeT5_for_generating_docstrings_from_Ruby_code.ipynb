    "As we will train the model using PyTorch Lightning, we first need to define a `LightningModule`, which is an `nn.Module` with some additional functionalities. We just need to define the `forward` pass, `training_step` (and optionally `validation_step` and `test_step`), and the corresponding dataloaders. PyTorch Lightning will then automate the training for us, handling device placement (i.e. we don't need to type `.to(device)` anywhere), etc. It also comes with support for loggers (such as Tensorboard, Weights and Biases) and callbacks.\n",
